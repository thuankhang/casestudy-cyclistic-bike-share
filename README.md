I am using mostly SQL for data processing and analyzing, R for visualizing and other data analytic skills. 
It seems that handling data will take a lot more time, but for the sake of practicing SQL, I choose to do this way.
There will be a version of doing this one in the best time optimizing (for me) later.

## Overview

This case study is from last course of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

In this case study, we will get better understanding about the difference of annual members and casual members using bikes. 
Our objective is to delve into the Cyclistic historical bike trip data, analyzing patterns, preferences, and behaviors of these two distinct groups.
The business goal is to design the strategies to maximizing the number of annual memberships, backed up with compelling data insights and data visualizations, which have been identified that more profitable for Cyclistic.
